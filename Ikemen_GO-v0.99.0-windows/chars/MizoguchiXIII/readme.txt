****Details***

  --------

    Basic Controls
    --------------
      Yadda yadda yadda play kof13. Ex motions require one stock of power. 
      Mizoguchi was not in kof13, obviously. So instead I give you a view
      of what could have been, that or the most rediculous thing I've
      ever given life to. To use God Mizoguchi hold start while selecting him.
      
      This Mizoguchi is a what-if for DLC. Obviously he appears more stronger 
      to really give off the vibe of being "DLC".
      
      We will use the notation:
      D/2 - down
      F/6 - forward
      U/8 - up
      B/4 - back
      x - button A

  Combo notes
  -----------

    Mizoguchi's strengths lie in his ability to chain moves into each
    other. Here are his basic combo rules:

      1.  You can combo from weaker basic attacks into stronger ones as 
          long as its the same type of attack on the ground.
          eg. cr.B -> D
          eg. A -> C
    
      2. You can cancel special attacks into super attacks for 1/2 Drive meter
         eg. Koryuu Sai -> Gottsui T. Bazooka

      3. You can cancel special attacks in to other special attacks
         eg. Koryuu Sai -> Ren Zoku Keri

      4. You cancel supers into NeoMax during Hyper Drive mode.
